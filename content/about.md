The Carolina Razor is a student-run news magazine at UNC Chapel Hill. Our mission is to tell extraordinary stories — the bizarre, overlooked, and important ones — and to provide a forum for student voices. 

Anyone can pitch or submit a story to the Razor, regardless of their affiliation with UNC or political orientation. Stories can come from anywhere — a crazy job or life experience, or a class assignment. We’re looking for unique perspectives that resonate with readers in the UNC community.

Our writers choose the stories they care about and write on their own schedule. This freedom lets writers unleash their passion, spend more time on each story, and develop better relationships with their sources. 

For us, very word counts. Our editors are involved in stories from their inception, and edit as the best advocates for our readers. They ask questions, cut fluff, and challenge our writers’ arguments until the writing is razor-sharp.

Our writing will be rigorously fact-checked and use the best studies, statistics, and other evidence. Our website will be fast, beautiful, and respectful.

It is easy to announce lofty goals like we have in this manifesto. But the past is littered with ambitious publications that have failed to go the distance.

Ultimately, our success will depend on you, our readers and writers. We must find the people who write and edit with these principles running through every bone in their body, and nurture, organize, and challenge them. We must find the readers who will support them, and delight and inspire them every single day.

If you see yourself among the above, please reach out. We hope to hear your ideas and read your stories.

Best,

The Editors
